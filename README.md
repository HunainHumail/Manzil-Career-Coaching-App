# Manzil (Mustaqbil ki Manzil) - Career Counselling App
 
### Background
In Pakistan, most of the students don't have the opportunity to get career counselling. Even when they are doing bachelors. They are continuously thinking about their career decision. Even after graduation, they feel ambiguous about there decision there whole life and that unevolving cycle continues for there children and there children.

Currently in Pakistan from the report of 2018 [less than 3%](https://nation.com.pk/23-Dec-2018/career-counseling) people choses to focus on their career goals. In recent years that percentage seems to be evolving but not exponentially.

As students, our usual counselling and mentorship is done by our parents but as the world is evolving we need to evolve the process of counselling and link expert peoples within the industries to the right set of students.

### Our Story
An undergrad and 2 grad friends, who has face gone through the similar phase in our lives. Notices the people around within our society. Some of us were focused and some of us was unclear of their career goal. As we have seen this phase in our lives. We know how someone feels and how they think about it. 

We know outside of Pakistan there are [companies](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/career-development-companies) and [NGO's](https://idreamcareer.com/organizations/) who are working day and night to serve right for their country. We find out that this field is overlooked by us and we don't tend to notice it.

We came up with an idea to bring change. **Manzil** an app which connects young students and counsellors. As students we have lot's of questions, which we will be clearing out using ***RIASEC Test*** and connecting them with industry experts who will be counselling them and helping them to choose the right career path.
